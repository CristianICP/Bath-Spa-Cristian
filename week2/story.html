            Walkthrough
        </h2>
        <p>
            When you reach your destination, which is a Nilfgaardian camp set on Marlin Coast, Avallac'h will be explaining his plan to everyone,<br>
             however Ciri will not be allowed to take part in the battle. After everything is explained he will tell Geralt to prepare his potions<br>
              and everything before they start - good idea so do just that while you have the chance. If you need repairs you can get them from a Nilfgaardian blacksmith.
        </p>

            <font color="yellow">Note</font>: If you romanced either Triss or Yennefer, Geralt will have one more conversation with the one he chose before you head out.
